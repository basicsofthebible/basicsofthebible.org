The ancient kingdom of Israel was united under Saul, David and Solomon, and split into the Northern kingdom of Israel (10 tribes) and the Southern Kingdom of Judah (and Benjamin). The narrative vignettes of events and rulers (several of which share the same or similar names!) shifts back and forth between the two kingdoms, making it challenging as a reader to follow along. Like *The Book of Job in Color* where the text is colored according to the speaker in question, here color is used to identify the kingdom in question (United, Israel, Judah), or in two cases, when the narrative focuses on Solomon or Elisha. Uses the World English Bible (WEB) version, a public domain translation available at [ebible.org](https://worldenglish.bible/).
