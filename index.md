Thank you for visiting basicsofthebible.org, a collection of free Bible visualizations.

## About
The groundwork for Basics of the Bible was laid in 2007 when I created study guides for family members and friends confused about the Bible and wanting to understand it better. I kept creating new materials, and launched the website in 2011 to freely share these resources with a larger audience. Everything here is free for personal enrichment and Christian educational purposes. The website has no advertising or banner ads, and no revenue of any kind is generated for its use. Thank you for visiting!

## Start here
