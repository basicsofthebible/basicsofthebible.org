I constructed this timeline so that the events of the Bible could be better visualized in the context of extrabiblical history, with an emphasis on the major societies of the world at the time. I mainly used *Ryrie Study Bible* and *Halleyâ€™s Bible Handbook* as resources for the Biblical timeline. The original format (Microsoft PowerPoint) was a bit more interactive and seamless than the present PDF version, but nonetheless retains much of the flavor of the original. I updated this work in 2012 with additional historical events, links to Wikipedia articles for selected events and a new reference: The *Mystery of History (Volume 1)* by Linda Lacour Hobar, which provides a great overview of history for the time periods covered in Interactive Timeline of Bible History.
