I read through the book of Job about once a year and find it very difficult to interpret. It occurred to me one day that it would be helpful to color the text according to each speaker, so that I could remember who is speaking (since Job is mainly a series of speeches written as poetry), with the hope that this would facilitate understanding and interpreting this complex and amazing book.
