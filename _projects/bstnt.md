I created this graphic as a means to visualize both the structure of the Bible as well as providing a rough timeline of the historical events recorded in each book of the Bible. Of course, when creating a big picture view such as this, it isnâ€™t always possible to accurately represent all the detailed historical information recorded in the Bible. The color scheme and structural organization of the books of the Bible was inspired by *Walk Thru the Old Testament*. The timeline material comes from my own research used in the *Interactive Timeline of Bible History*.
